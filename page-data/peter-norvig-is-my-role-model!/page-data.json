Most of the times, you can relate that by picking a role model. You want to orient your life around non-violence, Gandhi is probably the best role model. A role model is your benchmark. When you set a benchmark you tell yourself that this is the position I want to be, this is something I want to be. And you can measure how good or bad is it going for you for a certain period of your life, by the standards of your role model. You can evaluate your actions and their consequences on the longer objective of what you want to be like(i.e. your role model).</p>\n<p>I am a programmer. I want to be a good programmer, a better version of myself. I write software for a living. And I think this is not just another job. I find programming magical. Just look around yourself, in this era of automation, you will be able to appreciate the magic computer science has brought to us. I see myself writing good software solving real-world problems, which could add up to this magic in the years coming down the lane.</p>\n<h3>My role model</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://norvig.com/bio.html\">Peter Norvig</a>, an American computer scientist, is currently Director of Research at Google Inc. He is the co-author of <a href=\"http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/\">Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach</a>, the leading textbook in the field of Artificial Intelligence.</p>\n<p>My first encounter with Peter Norvig was via this book only. I read this book as part of my graduation curriculum. This book gave me the vision of another form of magic that computer science brings to our life, the AI.</p>\n<p>My next encounter with Peter was during a google search. A fine evening, I was doing a google search, on how to be a better programmer. I came across this <a href=\"https://norvig.com/21-days.html\">blog post</a> by Peter. This article gave me a different perspective, rather a life-changing. The arguments Peter made in this article really changed my views on programming and computer science.</p>\n<p>Peter has spent his whole life doing magical things in computer science, contributing to the larger context. I find Peter’s life to be very inspiring. Having worked in a huge set of domains in organizations like NASA, Google, Sun Microsystems, Peter continues to inspire me to be the better version of myself every day. He inspires me to learn, keep growing, moving fast, make some meaningful contribution to your field &#x26; grow sustainably.</p>\n<p>Keeping the teachings of Peter Norvig in mind, I try to align my career decisions in the best way possible. And let me tell you a fact, it’s been working pretty good so far! There is a fair share of failures, but I find it very sustainable and fun.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Thanks for reading.
