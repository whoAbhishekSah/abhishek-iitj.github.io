One can include such attacks in the category of hate crime. In India, mob lynching has mostly happened because of cow meat-related incidents and Hindu-Muslim hate.</p>\n<p>As per NDTV India report, there was only 1 incident of mob lynching reported between 2009 to 2014 during the UPA government. But from the period of 2014 till present, 109 incidents of mob lynching were reported. 40 people were killed and 123 were seriously injured.</p>\n<h3>Why do we need strict laws for mob lynching</h3>\n<p>There is no present codified law against lynching in India as such, however, Section 223 of the Criminal Procedure Code contains the provision for persons being charged for an offence jointly when they are accused of the same offence committed in the course of the same transaction.</p>\n<p>Just to highlight here, a trial court in Alwar acquitted all the accused on the benefit of the doubt in <a href=\"https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/alwar-lynching-all-6-men-accused-of-beating-pehlu-khan-to-death-in-2017-acquitted-2085191\">Pahlu Khan lynching case</a>. The video which recorded the crime was declared not solid evidence by the court. It was a failure of Rajasthan Police which resulted in justice denial for a victim.</p>\n<p>Given the situation of mob attacks in the country presently there is a need for separate legislation and strict implementation procedures to curb the attacks and punish the wrongdoers. The police and judiciary should resolve the cases of mob lynching very carefully. For this India needs strict mob lynching laws to establish a sense of fear in the wrongdoers.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"India needs strict mob lynching laws","date":"August 15, 2019","description":"BLOG"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/india-needs-strict-mob-lynching-laws/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/blockchain-is-revolutionary!/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blockchain is revolutionary!"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/the-evils-of-compulsory-attendance-criteria/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"The evils of compulsory attendance criteria"}}}}}
